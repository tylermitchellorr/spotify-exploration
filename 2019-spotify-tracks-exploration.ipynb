Common sense check; does this match up with your experience of music? \n\nAnother common sense check - does it make sense that acousticness has a negative correlation of > 0.40 with danceability, energy, and loudness? Absolutely! As a song gets 'more acoustic' it's less likely that the song is written such that it's meant to be played in a club with everyone dancing. As a song gets 'more acoustic', the energy and loudness will be lower to match the mellow energy of a typical acoustic track.\n\nA particularly interesting point comes at the instrumentalness-speechiness correlation of 0.44. Shouldn't it be the case that a highly instrumental track is *not* wordy? A possible explanation to explore here is that hip-hop music is counted as both highly instrumental and speechy. Since hip-hop accounts for a large portion of the top tracks, this genre alone could drive this correlation.
